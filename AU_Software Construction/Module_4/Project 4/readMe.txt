Description
For this phase of the course project, you will be adding functionality to your web browser in addition to modifying some of the existing GUI elements.

 

Create a new User Control:
Create a new User control that you will use in all of your tab pages, give your control a relevant name based on its purpose and functionality.
Move the ToolStrip and BrowserControl to your new user control.
Add your new user control inside the tab page to replace the separate controls you removed.  Note: Now your browser's tabs will contain the ToolStrip which makes it look a bit more like a typical web browser.
Make sure your web browser’s current functionality still works as expected after these modifications.
Implement functionality (note:  the WebBrowser component has methods that will help with each of these): 
A Refresh button: when clicked the browser will refresh the current page 
A Back button: as with the typical browser
A Forward button: as with the typical browser
In your MenuStrip control, implement the following functionality for the following menu items:
File -> New Tab (Ctrl + T) 
Create a new tab page.
Add a new instance of the new user control you created to that tab page.
Set the docking property of that control to “fill”.
File -> Close Current Tab (Ctrl + W)
Close currently selected tab.
 

Make sure all work is regularly committed in Git, preferably after each point of the assignment.

 

Requirements:
Submit a single zip file containing your solution folder using the following format: username_module4project.zip
Make sure your zip file contains the entire Git repository.
Upload your zip file to Canvas and submit.
